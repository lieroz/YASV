# YASV
## Yet Another Scene Viewer
* YASV is a learning project for graphics programming.
* It uses C# cause it is easier to manage dev and build dependencies than in C++.
* Silk.NET and Avalonia.UI are used for device and window management.
* RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface) only supports Vulkan graphics API right now.
* Vulkan backend is hugely based on [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).
* Some code parts use ideas from [Vulkan Guide](https://vkguide.dev/).
